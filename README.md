# Data-Science-project
The project subject is League of Legends, a large MOBA online game with million of online players per day. 
We used data acquisition with APIs that riot games provides, by writing a python script that connects 4 different API routes in sequence and store it on files with different paths. The script handles data cleanse and broken files, converting json to Python objects, scraping additional data from https://u.gg/ and more.
 The script used to handle the data, customize it and parse it to extract data that can be used later on for machine learning models and data visualization on jupyter notebook. With explained steps and conclusions for each step.
